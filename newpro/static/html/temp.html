The temple stands at the centre of Karaikudi town.  In the year 1956 on November 8, a little girl, Lalitha came to this place from Meenakshipuram with small pox attack throughout her body.  People found that every word from her tongue showed a divine and auspicious power.  Many people mocked at Her and the Tomato man was among them.  He practically realized her divinity.  The divine girl told them that She was but Maahamayee and would protect the residents if they raise a temple for Her.  She assured all peace and prosperity to all.  Saying these words, She attained Mukthi.  The temple came into being on 17th November, 1956.
